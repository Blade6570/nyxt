This directory contains projects that we need to reference from their
repository directly.

Potential reasons:

- Version on Quicklisp out of date
- Not available on Quicklisp

We store these in a directory that's excluded from recursion by ASDF.
as per =asdf/source-registry:*source-registry-exclusions*=.
This way we won't conflict with user or system libraries.
